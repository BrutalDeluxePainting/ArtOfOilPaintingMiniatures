# Oil Paints and Mediums

Oil paint is primarily composed of two main ingredients: drying oil and pigment. Drying oils, such as linseed oil, serve as the binder that holds the pigment particles together and adheres them to the painting surface. The pigments provide the color and can be made from various materials like minerals, synthetic compounds, or organic substances.

## Drying Oils

Drying oils in oil paint act as binders and undergo an oxidative process when exposed to air, transforming from a liquid to a solid state. This is different from acrylic paints, which dry through evaporation. The oxidative hardening provides durability and longevity to the paint. Linseed oil is often the go-to choice for drying oils due to its balanced properties of drying time, hardness, and flexibility.

### Oxidation vs. Evaporation

In high-level terms, oxidation is a chemical process where the paint reacts with oxygen in the air to harden. Evaporation, on the other hand, is a physical process where the water or solvent in the paint simply evaporates, leaving the pigment and binder behind. 

#### Speeding Up Processes

- **Oxidation**: To speed up oxidation in oil paints, you might use a medium that contains driers or alkyd resins, which act as catalysts to accelerate the hardening process.  
- **Evaporation**: In the case of acrylics, miniature painters often use a hair dryer to speed up the evaporation of the water or solvent, thus quickening the drying time.

### Types of Drying Oils

- **Linseed Oil**: The traditional oil used in oil painting. Increases gloss and transparency while reducing brush marks. Dries relatively fast but may yellow over time.
  - **Refined Linseed Oil**: Alkali-refined, pale-colored oil that increases gloss and transparency while slowing drying time.
  - **Cold Pressed Linseed Oil (Unrefined)**: Pale yellow in color, increases gloss and transparency. Reduces brush marks. Dries with the most flexible film of all the oils, so less likely to crack. Will yellow over time.
  - **Stand Oil**: Heated oil that changes at the molecular level. Heavy and thick, may need to be thinned with solvents. Lighter in color and yellows less with age. Dries to a smooth, enamel-like finish.
- **Safflower Oil**: Natural pale or colorless oils that yellow less than linseed oils. Good for making white paint and mixing with whites. Dries more slowly than linseed oil and has a weaker film, which can promote cracking with aging.
- **Walnut Oil**: Non-yellowing and dries a little faster than safflower and poppyseed oils. Adds vibrancy, fluidity, and resistance to cracking and yellowing.
- **Poppy Oil**: Similar to safflower oil but dries more slowly. Weaker film than linseed oils, which can promote cracking with aging.

As a rule of thumb, for miniature painting, you will want to stick to Oil paints made with some form of Linseed oil or Safflower oil. You will notice the majority of Titanium Whites are made with Safflower oil so they are less likely to yellow which will be more noticeable in a white paint then any other colour.

## Alkyd

Alkyd resins are synthetic resins used in some modern oil paints and mediums like Liquin to accelerate the drying process. They facilitate quicker oxidation and polymerization of the drying oils whilst also making the paint more transparent and less dark. Alkyd resins also affect the surface sheen of the paint, which can range from a low satin to a gloss sheen.

### A Note on Alkyd-Based vs. Linseed-Based Oil Paints

While specific data is lacking, it's commonly discussed among artists that alkyd-based oil paints may have a lower pigment load compared to linseed-based ones. The synthetic nature of alkyd resins may limit their ability to carry pigments as effectively as natural oils like linseed. For miniature painting, speeding up the drying times by using Alkyd medium like Liquin is preferable over using fast drying Alkyd-based paints such as Winsor & Newton Griffin oils.

## Driers

Driers are substances, usually metal-based compounds, added to oil paint to accelerate the drying process. They act as catalysts, speeding up the oxidation of the drying oil. Driers are used in small quantities and are mixed into the paint or medium to achieve faster drying times.

### Cobalt Siccative

Cobalt siccative is a specific type of drier that is highly effective in accelerating the drying process of oil paints. It is often used when a rapid drying time is desired. Cobalt siccative is usually available in liquid form and should be used sparingly, as excessive use can lead to problems like cracking or brittleness in the paint film.
While they are effective, it's crucial to exercise caution when using them due to their hazardous properties.
