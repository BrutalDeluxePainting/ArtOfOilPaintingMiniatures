# Art of Oil Painting Miniatures

## Introduction

When it comes to painting miniatures, oils offer a unique set of advantages that can elevate your art to the next level. Here's why you should consider using oils:

### Long Dry Times

The extended drying period of oils allows you the freedom to perfect your work over time. Mistakes can be easily corrected, and you have the flexibility to revisit and adjust colors and details.

### Seamless Airbrush-Like Blending

Oils provide a smooth, blendable texture that mimics the seamless gradients achieved by airbrushing. This enables you to create stunning transitions between colors, adding depth and realism to your miniatures.

### Zen-Like Painting Experience

The tactile nature of working with oils and the slower pace required can turn your painting sessions into a meditative, zen-like experience. It's not just about the end result; it's about enjoying the journey.
